Plant Colours:
	Strawberry - red Turret
	Pineapple - Green Turret
	Watermelon - Blue Turret
	Lettuce = Yellow Turret

When a plant has a fruit a small Cyan box will be created on top of it, and it will be removed when the fruit expires

Animal Models:
	Bunny - Vader's Tie
	Fox - Y-Wing
	Tiger - X-Wing
	Unicorns - Millenium Falcon

The animals' red colour increases porportionally to the amount of health they are missing, making them pure red when they hit 0 calories

Wait time has been reduced because as required by the assignment of a 0.5% loss of calories and waiting until the animals got to half their max calories would be a ~90 second wait for simulation to start.
